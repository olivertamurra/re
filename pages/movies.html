              >After is a 2019 American romantic drama film directed by Jenny
              Gage, based on the 2014 novel of the same name by Anna Todd. The
              screenplay is written by Susan McMartin, Tamara Chestna, and Jenny
              Gage. The film stars Josephine Langford and Hero Fiennes Tiffin,
              and follows an inexperienced teenage girl who begins to romance a
              mysterious student during her first months of college. The cast
              includes Selma Blair, Inanna Sarkis, Shane Paul McGhie, Pia Mia,
              Khadijha Red Thunder, Dylan Arnold, Samuel Larsen, Jennifer Beals,
              and Peter Gallagher in supporting roles.
              <br />
              Development of a film adaptation based on Todd's novel began in
              2014, when Paramount Pictures acquired the rights to the film
              adaptation and hired Susan McMartin as screenwriter. In 2017,
              CalMaple Media and Offspring Entertainment bought the rights, with
              writer Tamara Chestna hired to rework McMartin's script, and
              director Jenny Gage overseeing the script's final revisions. The
              film was also produced by Voltage Pictures, Diamond Film
              <br />
              Productions, and Frayed Pages Entertainment. In May 2018, Fiennes
              Tiffin was cast in the lead role alongside Julia Goldani Telles;
              in July of the same year, however, Goldani Telles dropped out due
              to scheduling conflicts, and was replaced by Langford. Principal
              photography began on July 16, 2018, and concluded on August 24
              that same year, with filming taking place in Atlanta, Georgia.
              After
              <br />
              premiered at The Grove in Los Angeles on April 8, 2019, before it
              was released in Latin America on April 10, 2019, by Diamond Films,
              and in the United States on April 12, 2019, by Aviron Pictures.
              The film received largely negative reviews from critics, who felt
              its screenplay and narrative glamourized abusive relationships.
              The film was a commercial success, grossing $69.7 million
              worldwide against its $14 million budget.
